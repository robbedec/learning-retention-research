  abstract = {In two experiments, we investigated what types of learning benefit from a cued recall test. After initial
exposure to a word pair (A+B), subjects experienced either an intervening cued recall test (A-->?)
with feedback, or a restudy presentation (A-->B). The final test could be cued recall in the same (A-->?)
or opposite (?-->B) direction, or free recall of just the cues (Recall As) or just the targets (Recall Bs).
All final tests revealed a benefit for testing as opposed to restudying. Tests produced a direct benefit for
information that was retrieved on the intervening test (B). This benefit also “spilled over” to facilitate
recall of information that was present on the test but not retrieved (A). Both theoretical and practical
implications are discussed.},

  abstract     = {When three quizzes on the content were spaced across the coverage of a unit, effects were robust, producing between 13\%and 25\% gains in performance on unit exams across a range of eighth-grade science topics, including genetics, evolution, anatomy, astronomy, and chemistry. Perhaps more telling, the proportion of otherwise unlearned material (i.e., material with incorrect answers for non-quizzed items) that benefited from quizzing was substantial, ranging from .61 (Experiment 2a) to .78 (Experiment2b, for the three-quizzed conditions). From the standpoint of projected grades, the benefits of quizzing were equally impressive. Performance levels on material that was not quizzed were at the C level for the school’s grading scale quizzing generally in-creased performance levels on the material to an A– level. This Isa robust effect, especially considering that the science teacher for this grade level provided conscientious, rich instruction for her students, with the classroom experience involving active learning exercises and demonstrations. The summative exams reflected the content emphasized in the textbook and the classroom activities. Even with these highly favorable pedagogical factors in place, quizzing improved learning and exam performance for the course content relative to no quizzing. Further, the present quizzing effects might slightly underestimate the true effect because quizzing can augment students’ performance on related content, and to the extent that in some cases random assignment distributed one of each into quiz and nonquiz conditions, then there would be a chance for some carryover effects to nonquizzed items. If this happened, the direct effect of quizzing would be underestimated because the control comparison would be too high (due to the spillover effect of quizzing on related items).},

  year     = {1986},
  abstract = {How much information from experience does a normal adult remember? The “functional information content” of human memory was estimated in several ways. The methods depend on measured rotes of input and loss from very long-term memory and on analyses of the informational demands of human memory based performance. Estimates ranged around 10’ bits. It is speculated that the flexible and creative retrieval of facts by humans is a function of a large ratio of “hardware” capacity to functional storage requirements.
Several different methods for estimating the approximate functional content of adult human memory have been tried. Estimates were obtained of the rate at which information is entered into, and lost from, long-term memory. These estimates were then used in three ways to arrive at total capacity estimates. One way assumed that information is accumulated linearly throughout life, yielding an estimate of 1.5 x 109 bits for a 35-year-old person. Second, the estimate was made more realistic by taking into account loss rates, reducing the amount of retrievable information held by midlife to around 109 bits. Third, the question of how much knowledge an adult needs to support knowledge-based behavior was considered. A guess of about 0.5 x 109, based largely on estimates derived from word knowledge, was hazarded. The estimates all point toward a functional learned memory content of around a billion bits for a mature person.},

The selective nature of scene perception, however, does not necessarily entail that visual representation is limited to the currently selected object. The results of this study demonstrate that visual object representations are retained in memory from previously attended regions of a scene. When attention is withdrawn from an object, there are indeed representational consequences of having attended that object. Thus, the present study supports a view of scene perception in which memory and perceptual processing are functionally integrated.},

Vervolgens onderzoekt ment aan de hand van gesloten vragen hoe de testpersonen leren voor een test.

Sterke studenten gebruiken effectieve studiemethodes zoals meer studeren dan gemiddeld, spreidend studeren, huiswerk, enz. en halen hierdoor betere resultaten dan gemiddeld. Zwakke studenten leggen de focus op minder effectieve studiemethodes zoals hoorcolleges volgen, niet op tijd beginnen met leren, niet maken van opgaves, enz. en halen hierbij slechtere resultaten dan gemiddeld. In de open vragen kan men ook concluderen dat studenten digitaal studiemateriaal essentieel vinden.

Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de testpersonen de website positief beoordelen en ook nood hebben aan dergelijke hulpmiddelen. In een volgend onderzoek zou men kunnen kijken of de website effectief verbetering brengt in de studieresultaten van de testpersonen. 

Het onderzoek bevat wel enkele opmerkingen die niet onbesproken kunnen worden. Als eerste opmerking deden er slechts 17 testpersonen mee aan de vragenlijst. De resultaten zijn dus niet volledig betrouwbaar. De opgestelde grafieken voldoen ook niet aan de ‘best-practices’ van wetenschappelijk onderzoek.

  abstract = {Doelgericht studeren is opgebouwd in een aantal belangrijke stappen. Zo zijn er al enkele stappen die je moet doornemen voordat je weldegelijk begint met studeren. Studeren doe je best in een rustige omgeving met zo weinig mogelijk afleiding. Je stelt voor jezelf concrete doelen en maakt hieruit een haalbare planning. Deze is best opgebouwd uit een afwisseling van studietijd en vrije tijd, zo houd je beter vol. Pauzes zijn belangrijk omdat je het meeste leert aan het begin en aan het einde van een studiesessie. Een laatste belangrijke stap voor je begint met studeren, is het overlopen van de structuur en opbouw van de leerstof a.d.h.v. de inhoudsopgave. In het artikel wordt niks gezegd over de meest efficiënte manier van studeren, ze geven enkel een aantal manieren om te studeren. Als je studeert door te onderstrepen lees je de tekst beter eerst globaal, en onderstreep je pas bij een tweede keer lezen, maar deze keer intensief lezen. Over aantekeningen maken, samenvattingen maken en schema’s maken werd ook gesproken, maar hiervoor moet je alsook intensief lezen om de hoofdzaken van de bijzaken te kunnen onderscheiden. Er werd ook duidelijk verteld dat je best na iedere studiesessie jezelf toetst op wat je zonet studeerde. Als je dan merkt dat je enkele onderdelen minder goed kent, kan je daarna bij het herhalen je focus daarop leggen. },

De finale conclusie is dat er geen effect was op de korte termijn van het onderzoek en dat men een langer onderzoek zou moeten voeren om effectieve resultaten te bekomen, maar er was wel een duidelijke toename in motivatie en voldoening wat er op zou wijzen dat de leerlingen zich bewuster en verantwoordelijker voelden over hun leerproces.},

De studenten waren allen 2de jaars studenten uit dezelfde school en allen hadden ze al enige kennis over het onderwerp waarop ze getoetst werden. Hun leeftijd varieerde van 20 tot 50 jaar oud. De eerste groep moest naar klassieke muziek luisteren tijdens het afleggen van de test, de tweede groep naar hip hop en de derde groep kreeg geen muziek te horen. De groep zonder muziek had de beste resultaten, maar het verschil met de groep die klassieke muziek luisterden was niet groot genoeg om de achtergrondmuziek als oorzaak aan te duiden. Bij de hip hop groep lagen de scores het laagst en bij deze groep was het duidelijk dat dit door de invloed van de muziek was. },

De focus ligt op hoe de leerling omgaat met de problemen en hoe hij betekenis geeft aan verschillende structuren en concepten. De student moet kunnen aantonen dat hij bronnen en instrumenten in het probleemoplossingsproces goed kan beheren. Hierbij wordt hij bijgestaan door een expert of ‘coach’. Kennis ontstaat in interactie met anderen en ‘learner agency’ te kunnen uitoefenen. Het is belangrijk om collaboratieve activiteiten op zodanige wijze te ondersteunen, dat de student deze kan uitvoeren terwijl hij gecoacht wordt door anderen. De coach is expert, soms instructor maar vaak een ‘peer’. Dit houdt in dat docenten of coaches mee uitzoeken, analyseren en reflecteren over de informatie die uit dialoog naar boven komt. Studenten worden beoordeeld door de evolutie in het leerproces, hoe ze omgaan met feedback en hoe ze problemen oplossen.},

  abstract     = {Deze studie focust op wat zowel leraar als leerling kunnen doen om beter te leren of beter leerstof aan te brengen. Het artikel volgt een zeer technische aanpak en baseert zich op de cognitieve wetenschap 

Leraar

Studie toont aan dat leerstof die wordt aangebracht a.d.h.v. de cognitive load theory en enorme verbetering biedt tegenover traditionele studiemethoden. De theorie houdt rekening met de limieten van het menselijk brein en zorgt ervoor dat er geen overload aan informatie gegeven wordt want die zetten een rem op het verwerken van nieuwe informatie. Een andere term die vaak terugkomt in het artikel is het constructivisme. Wanneer nieuwe leerstof gegeven wordt is het belangrijk dat de leraar eerst de vooroordelen van de student leert begrijpen en die al dan niet weerlegt indien ze fout zijn. Zo ontstaat er geen verwarring wanneer nieuwe informatie gegeven wordt over bestaande concepten.

Leerling

Het artikel legt nadruk op het belang van metacognitie. Metacognitie is de kennis over de eigen kennis. Het is een manier waarop je reflecteert over je eigen kennis van een bepaald onderwerp. Studie toont aan dat mensen die vaker aan metacognitie doen efficiënter kunnen leren. In het artikel wordt ook de vergelijking gemaakt tussen retrieval en traditionele leermethoden. De retrieval-methode bestaat eruit de geleerde informatie herhaaldelijk op te vissen uit het geheugen om zo de leerstof onder te knie te krijgen. De laatste methode die wordt aangehaald is de spaced learning methode. Deze methode verdeelt het aanleren van studiemateriaal op in een aantal perioden. Tussen de periode zit genoeg tijd zodat de leerlingen de tijd krijgen om te stil te staan bij de opgedane kennis. Deze methode staat tegenover de methode waar alle informatie in één periode in de hersenen gepropt wordt. 

Het artikel maakt gebruik van Cohen’s D (effectgrootte) om het verschil aan te tonen tussen de verschillende methoden.

A separate control group took no notes. On immediate and delayed post-tests, post hoc analyses with the depth (notetaking) condition showed the following ranking: summary = paraphrase > control = verbatim > letter search. A paraphrase notes × review × test-position interaction was significant, indicating that less forgetting occurred on a delayed post-test when students reviewed their paraphrase notes than when they read an interpolated text. Analysis of reading times showed that the additional time required for notetaking was only worthwhile when meaningful notes were taken.},

De vier methodes kunnen volgens dit artikel aldus worden geranschikt:
Samenvatten is ongeveer even effectief als parafraseren maar beter dan alles herschrijven.
Herschrijven heeft geen significant verschil t.o.v. de controle.
Het zoeken van letters zorgt ervoor dat de testnemer de tekst oppervlakkiger leest en heeft dus een negatief effect op het resultaat.},

It has been  hypothesized  that:  (a) text  absent  summarization  (i.e.,instructing  subjects to read a text and then  summarize it without referring  back tothe  text)  increases  the quality  of  processing  during  summarization,  and (b) thishigher  quality  processing  enhances  recall.  Sixth-grade  students  summarized  anexpository  text  in either  a text  absent  or text  present  condition,  and subsequentlywere  asked to do an oral  free  recall of the text.  Regression  analyses  indicated thattext  absent  summarization  resulted  in  lower  summary  content  in  general,  but ingreater summary depth for more able readers. Further regression analyses  indicatedthat  summary  depth  resulted  in  increased  recall  in  general,  whereas  summarycontent  was only  associated  with  recall  for text  absent  summarizers;  text  absencealone  did  not  result  in  greater  recall.

Basistips om je geheugen te verbeteren
Blijf nieuwe dingen leren en proberen
Leer op meerdere manieren
Leer iemand anders wat je zelf hebt geleerd
Gebruik voorgaande kennis om nieuwe te verwerven
Doe praktische ervaring op
Het is beter om de antwoorden op te zoeken dan te blijven trachten om ze te herinneren
Weet hoe je het best leert
Gebruik testen om je leren te boosten
Vergeet multitasking

Puntje4:
leer wat je geleerd hebt aan iemand anders...
In plaats van individueel te noteren wat je herinnert, met twee samen noteren (XP-achtig) beter resultaat dan solo?

Puntje7:
Het is beter om het antwoord op te zoeken als het te lang duurt om erop te komen, anders sla je de "error state" op in je geheugen

Puntje9:
Gebruik testen om je studeren te boosten
Komt overeen met de Roediger papers

Here, we show that practicing retrieval produces greater gains in meaningful learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping. The advantage of retrieval practice generalized across texts identical to those commonly found in science education. The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes. Retrieval practice is an effective tool to promote conceptual learning about science.

  abstract      = {Objectives Shift work, like chronic jet lag, is known to disrupt workers’ normal circadian rhythms and social life, and to be associated with increased health problems (eg, ulcers, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, breast cancer, reproductive difficulties) and with acute effects on safety and productivity. However, very little is known about the long-term consequences of shift work on cognitive abilities. The aim of this study was to assess the chronicity and reversibility of the effects of shift work on cognition.
Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of 3232 employed and retired workers (participation rate: 76\%) who were 32, 42, 52 and 62 years old at the time of the first measurement (t1, 1996), and who were seen again 5 (t2) and 10 (t3) years later. 1484 of them had shift work experience at baseline (current or past) and 1635 had not. The main outcome measures were tests of speed and memory, assessed at all three measurement times.
Results Shift work was associated with impaired cognition. The association was stronger for exposure durations exceeding 10 years (dose effect; cognitive loss equivalent to 6.5 years of age-related decline in the current cohort). The recovery of cognitive functioning after having left shift work took at least 5 years (reversibility).
Conclusions Shift work chronically impairs cognition, with potentially important safety consequences not only for the individuals concerned, but also for society.},

  comment       = {Studie over de invloed van ploegenarbeid op leervermogen.
Uitgevoerd over een periode van 10 jaar in 3 fases, om de 5 jaar.

Resultaat is dat ploegenarbeid een chronisch nefast effect heeft op leervermogen dat erger wordt naargelang de tijd dat de persoon dit levensritme aanhoudt. 
Het duurt minstens 5 jaar nadat de persoon terug een normaal patroon heeft om deze effecten teniet te doen

testmethodes:
- verbaal geheugen: deelnemers krijgen 16 woorden driemaal te horen en moeten telkens onmiddelijk de woorden herhalen, 
na 15 minuten van andere testen een free recall (opsommen) gevolgd door een uitgestelde herkenningstest uit 48 woorden moesten ze de 16 geleerde herkennen.

- een digit-symbol substitution subtest van de Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, een test die voornamelijk verwerkingssnelheid test.

- een selectieve aandachtstest uit twee delen
a) zo snel mogelijk een bepaalde letter zoeken in een lijn van 58 letters.
b) dezelfde test maar dan in zes lijnen van 58 letters een van 4 opgegeven letters.

3 analyses:

1) Heeft ploegenarbeid invloed op leervermogen, door ploegenarbeiders te vergelijken met arbeiders die nog nooit ploegenarbeid hebben verricht.
2) Het effect van de duur van de ploegenarbeid, door mensen te vergelijken die geen ervaring hebben met ploegenarbeid, mensen die tot 10 jaar aan ploegenarbeid zijn blootgesteld, en mensen die meer dan 10 jaar aan ploegenarbeid zijn blootgesteld.
3) Of er een chronisch effect is dat blijft na blootstelling, testpersonen werken nu in ploegen, zijn er in de voorbije 5 jaar mee gestopt zijn, zijn er al langer dan 5 jaar uit zijn of hebben er nooit mee te maken gehad.},

  abstract = {Both repeated practice and sleep improve long-term retention of information. The assumed common mechanism underlying these effects is memory reactivation, either on-line and effortful or off-line and effortless. In the study reported here, we investigated whether sleep-dependent memory consolidation could help to save practice time during relearning. During two sessions occurring 12 hr apart, 40 participants practiced foreign vocabulary until they reached a perfect level of performance. Half of them learned in the morning and relearned in the evening of a single day. The other half learned in the evening of one day, slept, and then relearned in the morning of the next day. Their retention was assessed 1 week later and 6 months later. We found that interleaving sleep between learning sessions not only reduced the amount of practice needed by half but also ensured much better long-term retention. Sleeping after learning is definitely a good strategy, but sleeping between two learning sessions is a better strategy.},
  comment  = {Dit artikel bekijkt het effect van slaap tussen het aanvatten van verschillende leer sessies.
In het artikel wordt aangetoond dat slaap een positief effect heeft op het onthouden van leerstof.
Als slaap al niet direct een resultaat heeft op het onthouden van leerstof tussen leersessies door, kan men alsnog aantonen dat slaap het gemakkelijker maakt om leerstof te herleren.},

  abstract = { Human cognition involves many mental processes that are highly interrelated, such as perception, attention, memory, and thinking. An important and core cognitive process is memory,
	which is commonly associated with the storing and remembering of environmental information. An interesting issue in memory research is on ways to enhance memory performance, and thus,
	remembering of information. Can colour result in improved memory abilities? The present paper highlights the relationship between colours, attention, and memory performance. The significance
	of colour in different settings is presented first, followed by a description on the nature of human memory. The role of attention and emotional arousal on memory performance is discussed next.
	The review of several studies on colours and memory are meant to explain some empirical works done in the area and related issues that arise from such studies.},
  comment  = {Hier wordt de positieve impact van kleur op het onthouden van informatie besproken. Er zijn drie soorten geheugen: het sensorisch register, korte termijn en lange termijn. In het sensorisch register wordt heel veel data opgeslagen voor een heel korte periode. Deze informatie is data dat men verzameld uit de directe omgeving. Om informatie van het sensorisch register geheugen naar het korte termijn te verplaatsen, moet men een bepaalde hoeveelheid aandacht besteden aan die informatie. Hoe meer aandacht er aan wordt besteed, hoe sneller het in het korte termijn geheugen zit. Dit is onder meer een van de redenen waarom multitasking niet werkt, de aandacht wordt verdeeld onder meerdere bronnen van informatie. Er wordt aangetoond dat kleur de aandacht kan versterken en dus zorgt voor beter opslaan van de informatie. Ook worden kleuren vaak met bepaalde gevoelens gekoppeld, bijvoorbeeld groen en kalmte. De gevoelens bij die kleuren hebben dan weer een effect op de aandacht. Uit de gerefereerde onderzoeken blijkt dat kleur een positieve impact heeft op het onthouden van informatie. Alhoewel we het exacte mechanisme van informatie opslaan hiermee niet duidelijk is, blijkt er wel een verband te zijn tussen het opslaan van informatie en de methode waarmee die informatie aangereikt wordt.},

In humans, these studies concentrated mainly on procedural types of memory, which are considered to be hippocampus-independent. Here, we show that sleep also has a persisting effect on hippocampus-dependent declarative memory. In two experiments, we examined high school students’ ability to remember vocabulary. We show that declarative memory is enhanced when sleep follows within a few hours of learning, independent of time of day, and with equal amounts of interference during retention intervals. Sleep deprivation has a detrimental effect on memory, which was significant after a night of recovery sleep. Thus, fatigue accumulating during wake intervals could be ruled out as a confound.},

Using nationally representative data from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, I analyze the effect of working on grades and credit completion for undergraduate students in the United States. Strategies to identify the causal relationship between working and academic performance include student-level fixed effects to control for permanent,
	unobserved characteristics that may affect both work and study intensity, and system GMM models to account for potentially endogenous relationships between working and academic performance that vary over time. I examine the consequences of working for heterogeneous subgroups, with a particular focus on differences between full-time and part-time students. I find no evidence that students’ grades are harmed by marginal work hours, but that full-time students complete fewer credits per term when increasing work},

Terwijl voor voltijdse studenten werken tijdens het studeren zorgt voor een lagere kredietscore op het einde van het semester. Dit kan onder andere komen door het vervangen van les gerelateerde activiteiten met werk.},

The results indicate that the class of preserved learning skills in amnesia is broader than previously reported. Amnesia seems to spare information that is based on rules or procedures, as contrasted with information that is data-based or declarative--"knowing how rather than "knowing that."

  abstract  = {Despite immense technological advances, learners still prefer studying text from printed hardcopy rather than from computer screens. Subjective and objective differences between on-screen and on-paper learning were examined in terms of a set of cognitive and metacognitive components, comprising a Metacognitive Learning Regulation Profile (MLRP) for each study media. Participants studied expository texts of 1000-1200 words in one of the two media and for each text they provided metacognitive prediction-of-performance judgments with respect to a subsequent multiple-choice test. Under fixed study time (Experiment 1), test performance did not differ between the two media, but when study time was self-regulated (Experiment 2) worse performance was observed on screen than on paper. The results suggest that the primary differences between the two study media are not cognitive but rather metacognitive--less accurate prediction of performance and more erratic study-time regulation on screen than on paper. More generally, this study highlights the contribution of metacognitive regulatory processes to learning and demonstrates the potential of the MLRP methodology for revealing the source of subjective and objective differences in study performance among study conditions.

  abstract = {People often attribute their reluctance to study texts on screen to technology-related factors rooted in hardware or software. However, previous studies have pointed to screen inferiority in the metacognitive regulation of learning. The study examined the effects of time pressure on learning texts on screen relative to paper among undergraduates who report only moderate paper preference. In Experiment 1, test scores on screen were lower than on paper under time pressure, with no difference under free regulation. In Experiment 2 the time condition was manipulated within participants to include time pressure, free regulation, and an interrupted condition where study was unexpectedly stopped after the time allotted under time pressure. No media effects were found under the interrupted study condition, although technology-related barriers should have taken their effect also in this condition. Paper learners who preferred this learning medium improved their scores when the time constraints were known in advance. No such adaptation was found on screen regardless of the medium preference. Beyond that, paper learning was more efficient and self-assessments of knowledge were better calibrated under most conditions. The results reinforce the inferiority of self-regulation of learning on screen and argue against technology-related factors as the main reason for this.},

Yet light quality varies substantially in nature and in controlled environments leading to questions of which artificial light characteristics facilitate maximum learning. Recent research has examined lighting variables of color temperature, and illumination for affecting sleep, mood, focus, motivation, concentration, and work and school performance. This has resulted in artificial light systems intended to support human beings in their actualization through dynamic lighting technology allowing for different lighting conditions per task. A total of 84 third graders were exposed to either focus (6000K-100fc average maintained) or normal lighting. Focus lighting led to a higher percentage increase in oral reading fluency performance (36\%) than did control lighting (17\%). No lighting effects were found for motivation or concentration, possibly attributable to the younger age level of respondents as compared with European studies. These findings illuminate the need for further research on artificial light and learning.},

While some research demonstrates that laptops can be an important learning tool, anecdotal evidence suggests more and more faculty are banning laptops from their classrooms because of perceptions that they distract students and detract from learning. The current research examines the nature of in-class laptop use in a large lecture course and how that use is related to student learning. Students completed weekly surveys of attendance, laptop use, and aspects of the classroom environment. Results showed that students who used laptops in class spent considerable time multitasking and that the laptop use posed a significant distraction to both users and fellow students. Most importantly, the level of laptop use was negatively related to several measures of student learning, including self-reported understanding of course material and overall course performance. The practical implications of these findings are discussed.},

  abstract      = {Learning is usually thought to occur during episodes of studying, whereas retrieval of information on testing simply serves to assess what was learned. We review research that contradicts this traditional view by demonstrating that retrieval practice is actually a powerful mnemonic enhancer, often producing large gains in long-term retention relative to repeated studying. Retrieval practice is often effective even without feedback (i.e. giving the correct answer), but feedback enhances the benefits of testing. In addition, retrieval practice promotes the acquisition of knowledge that can be flexibly retrieved and transferred to different contexts. The power of retrieval practice in consolidating memories has important implications for both the study of memory and its application to educational practice.},

  abstract      = { Taking a memory test not only assesses what one knows, but also enhances later retention, a phenomenon known as the testing effect. We studied this effect with educationally relevant materials and investigated whether testing facilitates learning only because tests offer an opportunity to restudy material. In two experiments, students studied prose passages and took one or three immediate free-recall tests, without feedback, or restudied the material the same number of times as the students who received tests. Students then took a final retention test 5 min, 2 days, or 1 week later. When the final test was given after 5 min, repeated studying improved recall relative to repeated testing. However, on the delayed tests, prior testing produced substantially greater retention than studying, even though repeated studying increased students' confidence in their ability to remember the material. Testing is a powerful means of improving learning, not just assessing it. },

  abstract = {Over the course of a 5-year applied research project with more than 1,400 middle school students, evidence from a number of studies revealed that retrieval practice in authentic classroom settings improves long-term learning (Agarwal et al. 2009; McDaniel et al., Journal of Educational Psychology 103:399–414, 2011; McDaniel et al. 2012; Roediger et al., Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied 17:382–395, 2011a). Retrieval practice, or the use of quizzes and exams to engage and enhance retrieval processes, has been widely established as an effective strategy for facilitating learning in laboratory settings (e.g., Roediger et al. 2011c). In this article, we review recent findings from applied research that demonstrate that retrieval practice enhances long-term classroom learning, delayed quizzes are particularly potent for retention, quizzes benefit students’ transfer to novel quiz items, and quizzes with feedback improve students’ learning and metacognitive awareness. In addition to generating evidence to support retrieval-based learning, these applied research studies also enhanced the professional development of the teachers, administrators, and scientists involved in the project. In this article, it is our hope that by sharing what we have learned from a variety of perspectives, applied scientific research in K-12 classrooms will continue to be explored and generated at local, state, and national levels, improving student learning and educational decision-making.
What began as an innovative grant from the Institute of Education Sciences grew into a 5-year project spanning nine teachers and more than 1,400 sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students from the state of Illinois. Columbia Middle School, in Columbia, IL, USA, was approached by professors from Washington University in St. Louis about forming a research partnership. When the conversations began, it was evident that this was a new endeavor for everyone—the school administrators, the teachers, the research staff, and the middle school students. Through hard work and a great deal of trial-and-error, findings from this project confirmed that retrieval practice via quizzing improves students’ long-term learning in an applied setting. In addition, middle school teachers and administrators became well versed in scientifically rigorous research, while university professors and scientists gained extensive experience in the implementation of classroom-based research.

Second, repeated testing is better than taking a single test. Third, testing with feedback leads to greater benefits than does testing without feedback, but even the latter procedure can be surprisingly effective. Fourth, the mnemonic benefits of retrieval practice are not limited to the learning of a specific response, but rather produce knowledge that can be transferred to different contexts.},

  abstract  = {Creative and critical thinking is one of the soft skill attributes expected of prospective graduates or learners. For one to
participate effectively in their working and social environment, studies have indicated that learners’ need to be exposed to a
variety of learning styles, strategies as well as creative and critical thinking skills. Such exposure maximizes ones’ potential to be
creative, critical and constructive thinkers deemed necessary for nation building and future human capital needs. As such, these
precious future human capital should not be left untapped to their own devices to discover their own learning styles as they step
foot in the university. Learning strategies need to be tailored to meet individual learning styles to capitalize on the learner’s
potential. In this context, the study attempts to uncover possible changes in the learner’s learning styles as a result of exposure to
various types of learning styles in a Thinking Skills Course conducted during the first semester of the first year of the learners’
program in the university. By identifying their learning strategies, an awareness of the best learning styles and strategies can be
improvised to best fit each individual. Such awareness will inadvertently create ripples in the teaching learning style of teachers.
Rather than applying a one fits all model of teaching, teaching styles can also be adapted at the initial stage of the learners’
studies. The lack of such insight results in a tremendous loss to identifying and aligning the learner’s potential to meet future
human capital needs.

  abstract  = {The basic idea behind the use of ‘Learning Styles’ is that learners can be categorized into one or more ‘styles’ (e.g., Visual, Auditory, Converger) and that teaching students according to their style will result in improved learning. This idea has been repeatedly tested and there is currently no evidence to support it. Despite this, belief in the use of Learning Styles appears to be widespread amongst schoolteachers and persists in the research literature. This mismatch between evidence and practice has provoked controversy, and some have labeled Learning Styles a ‘myth.’ In this study, we used a survey of academics in UK Higher Education (n = 114) to try and go beyond the controversy by quantifying belief and, crucially, actual use of Learning Styles. We also attempted to understand how academics view the potential harms associated with the use of Learning Styles. We found that general belief in the use of Learning Styles was high (58 percent), but lower than in similar previous studies, continuing an overall downward trend in recent years. Critically the percentage of respondents who reported actually using Learning Styles (33 percent) was much lower than those who reported believing in their use. Far more reported using a number of techniques that are demonstrably evidence-based. Academics agreed with all the posited weaknesses and harms of Learning Styles theory, agreeing most strongly that the basic theory of Learning Styles is conceptually flawed. However, a substantial number of participants (32 percent) stated that they would continue to use Learning Styles despite being presented with the lack of an evidence base to support them, suggesting that ‘debunking’ Learning Styles may not be effective. We argue that the interests of all may be better served by promoting evidence-based approaches to Higher Education.},

Methodology: We used a questionnaire with open-ended and close-ended questions to students (45) and interviews with open-ended questions to teachers (17). The categories analysed were organised in: tolerance and respect to differences and diversities, gender equality, respectful attitude towards sexual orientation, age differences, environmental care, experience in peace and solidarity situations, valorisation and respect to cultural diversities. Conclusions: Research results analysis of both in students’ and teachers’ perceptions revealed that in schooling context, considering the established interactions between teachers and students, and students between themselves, pointed to occasional situations of discrimination and prejudice hidden into “pleasantries” and “jokes” emulating ideological strategies of concealment and dissimulation of attitudes regarding lack of respect to the human dignity, considered a universal principle to the establishment of human rights.

Most research on the testing effect has been done with materials such as word lists, and the general finding has been that the benefits of testing are greater when the initial test is a recall (production) test rather than a recognition test. We briefly summarize three experiments that extend these results to educationally relevant materials, namely brief articles, lectures, and materials in a college course. All three experiments demonstrated a robust testing effect and also revealed that an initial short-answer test produced greater gains on a final test than did an initial multiple-choice test. Furthermore, one experiment revealed a positive effect of immediate feedback given with the initial test. The educational implications are that production tests (short answer or essay) and feedback soon after learning increase learning and retention. In addition, frequent testing probably has the indirect positive effects of keeping students motivated and leading them to space out periods of study.},

  abstract  = {Context

Educators often encourage students to engage in active learning by generating explanations for the material being learned, a method called self‐explanation. Studies have also demonstrated that repeated testing improves retention. However, no studies have directly compared the two learning methods.
Methods

Forty‐seven Year 1 medical students completed the study. All students participated in a teaching session that covered four clinical topics and was followed by four weekly learning sessions. In the learning sessions, students were randomised to perform one of four learning activities for each topic: testing with self‐generated explanations (TE); testing without explanations (T); studying a review sheet with self‐generated explanations (SE), and studying a review sheet without explanations (S). Students repeated the same activity for each topic in all four sessions. Six months later, they took a free‐recall clinical application test on all four topics.
Results

Repeated testing led to better long‐term retention and application than repeatedly studying the material (p < 0.0001, η2 = 0.33). Repeated generation of self‐explanations also improved long‐term retention and application, but the effect was smaller (p < 0.0001, η2 = 0.08). When data were collapsed across topics, both testing conditions produced better final test performance than studying with self‐explanation (TE = 40 percent > SE = 29 percent [p = 0.001, d = 0.70]; T = 36 percent > SE = 29 percent [p = 0.02, d = 0.48]). Studying with self‐explanation led to better retention and application than studying without self‐explanation (SE = 29 percent > S = 20 percent; p = 0.001, d = 0.68). Our analyses showed significant interaction by topic (p = 0.001, η2 = 0.06), indicating some variation in the effectiveness of the interventions among topics.
Conclusions

Testing and generating self‐explanations are both learning activities that can be used to produce superior long‐term retention and application of knowledge, but testing is generally more effective than self‐explanation alone.},

Design: An interventional study Setting: a public university in Jordan.
Subjects: Used a purposive sample of 92 nursing students who were enrolled in
maternity nursing course.
Main Outcome measures: Measure the difference in learning styles of nursing students after introducing an intervention of PBL as a teaching methodology.
Results: The dominant learning preference of the students was the read/write preference followed by the kinesthetic, still most of the students represented a
multimodal learning preference. No significant difference was found between males and females. A significant difference in the learning preferences of the students in the pre-post test was found. In the pretest the mean of the total VARK score 13.9 (SD = 2) where as in the post test the mean of the total VARK score = 16.5 (SD = 3.5). In the pre-test 54 percent of students had a multimodal preference whereas 68 percent of students have a multimodal preference post-test.
Conclusions: Most students are able to learn effectively as long as the instructor provides different learning activities in the areas assessed in VARK. Active learning might be enhanced in large classrooms by presenting models and demonstrations, discussions, debates, answering questions, and role playing.},

In the present experiment, we tested whether, relative to study practice, retrieval practice would improve post-stress memory by increasing access to both item and source information. Participants learned two wordlists, which were temporally segregated to facilitate distinction between the two lists. Participants returned one week later for stress induction and two memory tests. Each test featured a recognition test that was given to assess item memory accessibility, and a list-discrimination task that was given to assess source memory. Relative to study practice, successful retrieval practice during learning reduced false alarms but did not improve source memory on the post-stress test. Results are discussed as they relate to current theories surrounding stress effects and retrieval practice effects.},

  abstract  = {Retrieval practice tends to produce better long-term learning than rereading, but laboratory studies have typically used arbitrary material that subjects may not care to learn. The observed advantage of retrieval practice may be exaggerated because low motivation may result in deficient processing during (usually passive) rereading. Thus, when subjects are motivated to learn the material, the type of study strategy (whether retrieval practice or rereading) might be less important. To test this hypothesis, we conducted 3 experiments in which we manipulated the incentives (using monetary bonuses or time savings) for learning Swahili–English word pairs. Items that had undergone retrieval practice were better recalled than reread items on a final test 2 days later, but this effect did not interact with incentive level. These results provide some reassurance that lab findings from the testing effects literature likely generalize to real-world situations in which motivation to learn may be greater.},

  abstract  = {Taking a memory test not only assesses what one knows, but also enhances later retention, a phenomenon known as the testing effect. We studied this effect with educationally relevant materials and investigated whether testing facilitates learning only because tests offer an opportunity to restudy material. In two experiments, students studied prose passages and took one or three immediate free-recall tests, without feedback, or restudied the material the same number of times as the students who received tests. Students then took a final retention test 5 min, 2 days, or 1 week later. When the final test was given after 5 min, repeated studying improved recall relative to repeated testing. However, on the delayed tests, prior testing produced substantially greater retention than studying, even though repeated studying increased students' confidence in their ability to remember the material. Testing is a powerful means of improving learning, not just assessing it.},

For the two control groups, the prediction task was omitted. All four groups then learned a third list without test trials and made judgments of knowing for items in this list. Subjects who had received test trials showed consistently higher prediction accuracy on the first two lists but their accuracy decreased on the third list when test trials were absent.

  abstract = {Over the course of a 5-year applied research project with more than 1,400 middle school students, evidence from a number of studies revealed that retrieval practice in authentic classroom settings improves long-term learning (Agarwal et al. 2009; McDaniel et al., Journal of Educational Psychology 103:399–414, 2011; McDaniel et al. 2012; Roediger et al., Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied 17:382–395, 2011a). Retrieval practice, or the use of quizzes and exams to engage and enhance retrieval processes, has been widely established as an effective strategy for facilitating learning in laboratory settings (e.g., Roediger et al. 2011c). In this article, we review recent findings from applied research that demonstrate that retrieval practice enhances long-term classroom learning, delayed quizzes are particularly potent for retention, quizzes benefit students’ transfer to novel quiz items, and quizzes with feedback improve students’ learning and metacognitive awareness. In addition to generating evidence to support retrieval-based learning, these applied research studies also enhanced the professional development of the teachers, administrators, and scientists involved in the project. In this article, it is our hope that by sharing what we have learned from a variety of perspectives, applied scientific research in K-12 classrooms will continue to be explored and generated at local, state, and national levels, improving student learning and educational decision-making.},

However, it is rarely studied whether other processes (e.g., metacognitive monitoring) during retrieval practice may also play an important role. In two experiments, we examined whether the effectiveness of retrieval was affected by subjects' confidence in their retrieval success. Subjects studied word-pairs and rated their confidence after each practice test trial (cued-recall in Exp.1, multiple choice in Exp.2), or re-study trial. In both experiments, we observed the classic retrieval practice effect. Moreover, in Exp.2, the benefits differed as a function of subjects' confidence in their retrieval performance: the effect of retrieval practice only emerged for high-confidence trials with higher than 56% confidence. In summary, the retrieval practice only facilitates the retention of correct answers with high confidence.},

The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes.

This intervention may enable residents to transfer learned skills from theoretical testing situations to real-life scenarios.

Experiences of adolescence can be exerted positive and negative effects on brain development. Physical exercise has a positive effect on brain function, which is characterized by improving memory function and increased neural plasticity. High fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity has a negative effect on brain function, which is characterized by insulin resistance and neuroinflammation and reduced microvessel constructure. Although the positive effect of exercise and negative effect of obesity on cognitive function have been documented, it has not been well whether comparison of the effects of exercise and obesity on cognitive function in adolescent rats. In the present study, we evaluated the behavioral changes related to cognitive function induced by exercise and obesity in adolescent rats. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (CON), the exercise group (Ex), the high fat diet group (HFD). The HFD containing fat 60% was freely provided. The present results showed that spatial learning ability and short-term memory did not show significant effect exercise as compared to the control group. The present results showed that spatial learning ability and short-term memory was significantly decreased HFD-induced obesity group as compared to the control group. These results suggest that positive effect of physical exercise in adolescence rats may be exerted no significant effect on cognitive function. But, negative effect of HFD-induced obesity might induce cognitive impairment. HFD-induced obesity in adolescent rats may be used as an animal model of neurodevelopmental disorders.},

In 2 experiments, subjects took an initial multiple-choice test on generalknowledge facts and made a confidence judgment after each response. Feedback was provided for halfof the questions, and retention was assessed by a final cued-recall test. Taking the initial test improvedretention relative to not testing, and feedback further enhanced performance. Consistent with priorresearch, feedback improved retention by allowing subjects to correct initially erroneous responses. Ofmore importance, feedback also doubled the retention of correct low-confidence responses, relative toproviding no feedback. The function of feedback is to correct both memory errors and metacognitiveerrors.},

Participants read the text twice, either in immediate succession (massed repetition), with a 4‐day interstudy interval (spaced short), or with a 3.5‐weeks interstudy interval (spaced long). Two days after the second study trial, all participants were tested. The results demonstrated that students in the spaced‐short condition remembered more of the content than those in the massed condition. By contrast, students in the spaced‐long condition remembered as much as students in the massed condition. These results were interpreted in terms of a theoretical framework, which combines mechanisms of encoding variability and study‐phase retrieval to account for the spacing effect. },

Landauer and Bjork (1978) argued for the superiority of expanding intervals, whereas more recent research has often failed to find any advantage. However, these prior studies have generally compared expanding versus equal-interval training within a single session, and have assessed effects only upon a single final test. We argue that a more generally important goal would be to maintain high average performance over a considerable period of training. For the learning of foreign vocabulary spread over four weeks, we found that expanding retrieval practice (i.e., sessions separated by increasing numbers of days) produced recall equivalent to that from equal-interval practice on a final test given eight weeks after training. However, the expanding schedule yielded much higher average recallability over the whole training period.},

This hypothesis stems  from  work  on  desirable  difficultiesand  the effortful  retrieval  hypothesis. Our  data  source  was  an experiment that used a 2 (question depth: factual, applied) x 2 (answer format: multiple   choice,   short   answer)   between-subjects   design   to investigate  the  effects  of  these  conditionson  retrieval  practice performance.The   experiment   was   delivered   online   though Mechanical  Turk  (n =  178).A  logistic  regression  predicting performance during practice indicates thatparticipants get more (in terms  of  an  increase  in  future  predicted  success)  from  successful retrievals of items that fall  within the more difficult level of both the format and depth factors (i.e., short answer and applied). There is  also  some  support  that  the  benefit  from  multiple  choice  items may  be  increased  by  askingdeeper,  more  applied  questions.

This recent trend has forced instructors to address the educational consequences of using these mobile devices. The purpose of the current study was to analyze and assess beneficial and challenging laptop behaviours in higher education classrooms. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 177 undergraduate university students (89 males, 88 females). Key benefits observed include note-taking activities, in-class laptop-based academic tasks, collaboration, increased focus, improved organization and efficiency, and addressing special needs. Key challenges noted include other student�s distracting laptop behaviours, instant messaging, surfing the web, playing games, watching movies, and decreased focus. Nearly three-quarters of the students claimed that laptops were useful in supporting their academic experience. Twice as many benefits were reported compared to challenges. It is speculated that the integration of meaningful laptop activities is a critical determinant of benefits and challenges experienced in higher education classrooms.},

  abstract  = {Context  Simulators provide an effective platform for the learning of clinical motor skills such as endotracheal intubation, although the optimal learning technique remains unidentified. We hypothesised that, for novices, experiential learning would improve the learning and retention of endotracheal intubation compared with guided learning. Methods  Year 4 medical students were randomised to either guided or experiential learning. Students in the guided group were taught using the conventional step-by-step technique. Students in the experiential group had to work out the correct technique for intubation on their own. Both groups had further opportunities to intubate manikins and patients during their postings. The students were recalled 3, 6, 9 and 12 months later, and their intubation skills assessed in four major categories: equipment preparation; intubation technique; successful intubation, and placement confirmation. Results  A total of 210 students (107 guided, 103 experiential) participated in the study. At 3 months, 64.5% of the students in the experiential group successfully intubated the manikin, compared with 36.9% in the guided group (P < 0.001). The experiential group also had higher overall scores, signifying quality of intubation attempts, at 3 months (79% versus 70%; P < 0.001). Success rates and overall scores for both groups were comparable at 6 and 9 months, but were better in the experiential group at 12 months. Success rates improved with time, reaching 86% at 12 months. Conclusions  Novices learned and retained the skill of endotracheal intubation better with experiential learning. This study suggests that experiential learning should be adopted for the teaching of endotracheal intubation and that refresher tuition at 3-monthly intervals will prevent the decay of this skill in infrequent users.},

  abstract = { We recently reported that collaborative testing (i.e., group test taking) increased student performance on quizzes. It is unknown, however, whether collaborative testing improves student retention of course content. Therefore, this study was designed to test the hypotheses that collaborative-group testing improves student retention of course content. To test this hypothesis, our undergraduate exercise physiology class of 38 students was randomly divided into two groups: group A (n = 19) and group B (n = 19). During exam 1, students from both groups answered questions in the traditional format as individuals. Immediately after completing the exam as individuals, students from group A answered a randomly selected subset of questions from exam 1 in groups of two (1 group had 3 students) to test the effectiveness of collaborative-group testing on test performance and level of student retention. On the next exam (exam 2, 4 wk later), students from both groups answered questions in the traditional format as individuals and responded to the same subset of questions from exam 1. The subset of questions was analyzed to determine the level of retention of the original test material. In addition, immediately after completing the exam as individuals, students from group B answered a randomly selected subset of questions from exam 2 in groups of two (1 group had 3 students). Finally, on the next exam (exam 3, 4 wk later), students from both groups answered questions in the traditional format as individuals and responded to the same subset of questions from exam 2. This protocol followed a randomized crossover design to control for time and order effects. Student retention of course content was reduced when students completed the original examinations individually. In sharp contrast, student retention was improved (P < 0.05) when students completed the original examinations in groups. Results suggest that collaborative testing is an effective strategy to enhance learning and increase student retention of course content. },

  abstract  = {The purpose of this study was to explore the hypothesis that learning is enhanced through the act of teaching others. Specifically, two experiments aimed to disentangle the relative effects of teaching expectancy (i.e., preparing to teach) and actually teaching (i.e., explaining to others for instructional purposes) on learning. Some participants studied a lesson on the Doppler Effect without the expectation of later teaching the material and then took a comprehension test on the material (control group). Other students studied the same lesson with instructions that they would later teach the material; of those expecting to teach, some participants actually taught the material by presenting a brief video-recorded lecture before being tested (teaching group), whereas others only prepared to teach before being tested (preparation group). Results of Experiment 1 indicated that both the preparation group and teaching group significantly outperformed the control group on an immediate comprehension test (Teaching vs. Control: d=0.82; Preparation vs. Control: d=0.59). However, when the same test was given following a one-week delay (Experiment 2), only the teaching group significantly outperformed the control group (Teaching vs. Control: d=0.79; Preparation vs. Control: d=0.24). Overall, these findings suggest that when students actually teach the content of a lesson, they develop a deeper and more persistent understanding of the material than from solely preparing to teach.},

The students were recalled 3, 6, 9 and 12 months later, and their intubation skills assessed in four major categories: equipment preparation; intubation technique; successful intubation, and placement confirmation. Results  A total of 210 students (107 guided, 103 experiential) participated in the study. At 3 months, 64.5% of the students in the experiential group successfully intubated the manikin, compared with 36.9% in the guided group (P < 0.001). The experiential group also had higher overall scores, signifying quality of intubation attempts, at 3 months (79% versus 70%; P < 0.001). Success rates and overall scores for both groups were comparable at 6 and 9 months, but were better in the experiential group at 12 months. Success rates improved with time, reaching 86% at 12 months. Conclusions  Novices learned and retained the skill of endotracheal intubation better with experiential learning. This study suggests that experiential learning should be adopted for the teaching of endotracheal intubation and that refresher tuition at 3-monthly intervals will prevent the decay of this skill in infrequent users.},

  abstract = {Theorists agree that writing can be a valuable tool for learning content, not just a way to report what has been learned (Applebee, 1981; Emig, 1977; Walshe, 1987). Cooper (in Applebee. 1981). stated that current practices fail to develop students ’ writing abilities and also give students no understanding of the ways in which writing can be most useful to them. Most writing activities in secondary schools call for students to report facts, rather than to think reflectively about the subject matter. Students write to record what they thii they are supposed to learn and then they report in writing what they recorded. The idea that writing is a method of learning is based on simple principle: when students write, they process information in a physical, tangible form. Writing activities require students to explore ideas, discover relationships, observe contrasts, sequence ideas, and process information (Fulwiler & Young, 1982; Gage, 1986). McGinley and Tierney (1989) pointed to writing as a means to improve the thinking and reasoning ability of students in academic subjects. Walshe (1987) concluded that writing activities increase the quality of learning by helping students clarify ideas and relationships between them.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a study to analyze the use of augmented reality (AR) for delivering multimedia content to
support the teaching and learning process of the digestive and circulatory systems at the primary school level,
and its impact on knowledge retention. Our AR application combines oral explanations and 3D models and
animations of anatomical structures. A validation study was conducted with fourth grade students in order to
evaluate the effect of our tool on knowledge retention. In this study, we attempt to verify whether students using
the AR application retained more concepts that those learning the topic in a traditional setting. Results show an
increased knowledge retention on students using AR multimedia contents as opposed to those following a
traditional course, which validates AR technology as a promising tool to improve students’ motivation and
interest, and to support the learning and teaching process in educational contexts.�},

De methode waarmee vergeleken wordt is eleborative studying, bij deze methode is het de bedoeling dat de student het onderwerp zelf ontdekt en zelf de verbanden tussen feiten kan leggen. Dit met de gedacht dat als je zelf iets uitzoekt je dit beter zou kunnen. Deze methode wordt heel vaak aangeraden door docenten en proffen aan studenten.

  abstract = {Two experiments investigated the long-term effects of retrieval practice. In the retrieval-practice procedure, selected items
from a previously studied list are repeatedly recalled. The typical retrieval-practice effects are considerably enhanced memory
for practiced items accompanied by low levels of recall, relative to baseline, for previously studied items that are associated
with the practiced items but were not themselves practiced. The two experiments demonstrated that the former effect
persisted over 12 hr; the latter effect also persisted over 12 hr, but only if a period of nocturnal sleep occurred during the
retention interval. We propose that consolidation processes occurring during sleep, and possibly featuring some form of offline
rehearsal, mediate these long-term effects of retrieval practice.},

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and Sleep Research Society (SRS) developed a consensus recommendation for the amount of sleep needed to promote optimal health in adults, using a modified RAND Appropriateness Method process. The recommendation is summarized here.

  abstract = {Sleep has been implicated in the plastic cerebral changes that underlie learning and memory. Indications that sleep participates in the consolidation of fresh memory traces come from a wide range of experimental observations. At the network level, reactivations during sleep of neuronal assemblies recently challenged by new environmental circumstances have been reported in different experimental designs. These neuronal assemblies are proposed to be involved in the processing of memory traces during sleep. However, despite this rapidly growing body of experimental data, evidence for the influence of sleep discharge patterns on memory traces remains fragmentary. The underlying role of sleep in learning and memory has yet to be precisely characterized.},
